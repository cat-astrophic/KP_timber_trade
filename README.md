# KP_timber_trade

This repo contains the scripts necessary for a paper looking at the impact of the Kyoto Protocol on the structure of the global timber trade network and the competition graph derived therefrom. Data comes from FAOstat (the file name is: Forestry_Trade_Flows_E_All_Data.csv) and can be downloaded freely from them.

The paper is currently under review at *Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews*.
